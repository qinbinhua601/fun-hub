## fun-hub
A hub for aggregating the tv series which I'm following :)

## installation
```
  npm install
```

## install mongodb
[mondodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Roadmap
- [x] replace filter current list by searching directly from the db #1
- [ ] modify the site to SPA (include the vue-router)
- [ ] make the favorite page much more neater and cleaner
- [ ] crawl the episode link(ep1, ep2, ep3...) if existed e.g. qq video's episode link list (save to the Video model)
- [ ] save the user favorite to the server ?
- [x] replace the ip with a subdomain to visit
- [ ] maybe a litte bit cache from the client side ?
## how to run
